# Project 1: 

# Project 2: Recommender System

## Project Description

This project implements a recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## Objectives

- Analyze user-item interaction data.
- Implement collaborative filtering algorithms to generate recommendations.
- Evaluate the performance of the recommender system using metrics such as precision and recall.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for building recommender systems)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation 

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scikit-surprise

## Perspectives 

Future work could involve enhancing the model by incorporating additional data sources, such as user demographics or item metadata, to improve the quality of recommendations. Additionally, exploring deep learning techniques for recommendation systems could yield better results.

# Project 3: Stock Price Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. We utilized historical stock price data to train our model and make forecasts about future prices.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical stock price data.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict future prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Methodologies

We implemented a set of code that allows for analysis and the establishment of a prediction model:

- Reading Tesla stock price data
- Univariate analysis of variables
- Bivariate analysis of variables
- Checking for missing values
- Searching for the best parameters
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets
- Implementing 16 prediction models to determine the best model
- Searching for the best parameters for the chosen model
- Optimizing the chosen model
- Displaying predicted data and actual data

## Perspectives

We could have had a better analysis by considering our database as a time series, which would have helped in achieving better insights.
