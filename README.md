# Project 3: Stock Price Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. We utilized historical stock price data to train our model and make forecasts about future prices.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical stock price data.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict future prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Methodologies

We implemented a set of code that allows for analysis and the establishment of a prediction model:

- Reading Tesla stock price data
- Univariate analysis of variables
- Bivariate analysis of variables
- Checking for missing values
- Searching for the best parameters
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets
- Implementing 16 prediction models to determine the best model
- Searching for the best parameters for the chosen model
- Optimizing the chosen model
- Displaying predicted data and actual data

## Perspectives

We could have had a better analysis by considering our database as a time series, which would have helped in achieving better insights.
